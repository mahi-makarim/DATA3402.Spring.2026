Everything you need to know is there, including very useful examples. In some cases, solutions are simply minimal modifications of code from lecture. Test your solution and demonstrate that it works as explect. If a problem's solution is eluding you, practice solving problems in the same way as in class, make a plan and decompose it into smaller parts before coding. If it doesn't work correctly, iterate until it does or you are stuck.\n",
